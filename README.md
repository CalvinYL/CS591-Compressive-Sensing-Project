# Visual Salience Project

Included in this repository are:
1) The code for both implementations of Salient Object Detection (Hou and LSMD)
2) A comprehensive report on our project including how the algorithms work, how they differ, the algorithms respective results, and our findings.

Due to the upload limitations on Github, you may view the project in its entirety (including datasets of the images and videos that we used to test the algorithms on, our results, and our presentation slides) on my Google Drive ([LINK](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_NPQl372sReQThjM2tfNTBNM28)).
